## Project Overview

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities Surat, Ahmedabad and Vadodara. They want to expand to other metros/Tier 1 cities in the next 2 years.

AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues.

Me Being Analyst decided to use a standard approach to measure the service level measured
 -**On-time delivery (OT) %
 -**In-full delivery (IF) %
 -** OnTime in full (OTIF) %
 -**Line Fill Rate(LiFR) %
 -**Volume Fill Rate(VoFR)%
 of the customer orders daily basis against the target service level set for each customer.
